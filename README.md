# Single-pass-EMCD-analysis-code

This repository contains the code used to analyze the single-pass EMCD data and generate the figures in the paper "Single-pass STEM-EMCD on a zone axis using a patterned aperture: progress in experimental and data treatment methods".  It was written in Matlab 2018b.  The dependencies are listed in the script "PatternedApertureWorkflow.m" or PatternedApertureWorkflow.mlx" (Matlab live script).  

The data in the paper can be downloaded from Zenodo:
